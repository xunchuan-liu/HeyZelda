Find your Python version by python --version mine is 3.8.1 for example
Find the appropriate .whl file from here (https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyaudio), for example mine is PyAudio‑0.2.11‑cp37‑cp37m‑win_amd64.whl, and download it.
Go to the folder where it is downloaded for example cd C:\Users\foobar\Downloads
Install the .whl file with pip for example in my case:
pip install PyAudio-0.2.11-cp37-cp37m-win_amd64.whl
pip install SpeechRecognition
pip install pynput
